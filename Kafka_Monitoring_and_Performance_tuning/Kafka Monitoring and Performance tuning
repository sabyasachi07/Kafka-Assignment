To optimize the performance of kafka cluster we optimize the performance in three level
1) producer level
2) Broker level
3) Consumer level

For producer level :-
 request.received.acks = 0 (No acknowledgment)
 			 1  (producer gets acknowledgment after leader replica gets data)
 			 all (producer gets acknowledgment after all in-sync replicas gets message)
 			 
 			 enable.idempotent=true to avoid duplicate messages
 			 
 For broker level :-
  Always plan for high number of partitions or num.partitions to be increased for better paralleleism.
  Adjust log.retention.hours depending upon disk space and the client need.

 For consumer level :-
  Check for max.poll.records and fetch.min.bytes and adjust according to your requirements and addding more consumer groups.
